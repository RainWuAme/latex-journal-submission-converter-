# LaTeX Style Converter

When submitting journal articles, most journals require a single .tex file and figures named as Fig1, Fig2, etc.
This tool helps convert LaTeX documents by extracting figures, creating a single main file, and generating a .bib file with only cited references.

## Setup and Usage

1. **Preparation**
   - Copy `latex_style_converter.py` to your local folder.

2. **Running the Converter**
   - Execute the script:
     ```
     python latex_style_converter.py --main_name Main.tex --figure_path ../Figures --latexpand_path ../latexpand
     ```
     Please modify your main_name, figure_path, and latexpand_path if needed.

3. **Note**
   - For Windows user, wsl is recommended.
